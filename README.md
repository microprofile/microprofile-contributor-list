# How to be listed as a contributor

To be added as a contributor on the microprofile.io Website:

* Submit a PR on this readme file.
* Once your PR is merged, you will be added to the [list of contributors in this project] (https://github.com/microprofile/list/graphs/contributors)
* That list gets pulled into the microprofile.io/contributors page
* Then please visit the [People] (https://github.com/orgs/microprofile/people) page and flip your "Organization visibility" preference from "Private" to "Public"
