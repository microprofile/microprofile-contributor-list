# How to be listed as a contributor

To be added as a contributor on the microprofile.io Website:
  
* Fork the repository
* Submit a Pull Request on this readme file from your fork.
* Once your Pull Request is merged, you will be added to the [list of contributors in this project] (http://microprofile.io/contributors) on the the microprofile.io/contributors page.


Note: Never submitted a Pull Request before? There are [help pages here.] (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
